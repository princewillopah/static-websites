To firmly establish responsibility for environmental and social issues at the highest level, the relevant principles are reflected in our HSSE Policy. We develop our internal policies and standards based on internationally recognized principles of responsible entrepreneurship. The basis for this is our Code of Conduct, which is binding for all employees. Other tools include internal audits, the implementation of certified management systems, and a statistical monitoring of key performance indicators (Key Performance Indicators – KPIs). Because sustainability for us is about ensuring our future viability, it will be integrated even more closely into our investment decisions as well as our daily workflows and processes in the future.</p>
