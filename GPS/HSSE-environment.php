                                “Everything we do have an immediate and indirect influence on the environment. As a result, we aim to make every effort to establish ourselves as an ecologically responsible firm in our business operations - a company that minimizes its negative influence on the environment.”
                            </p>
                            <p class="disc"> We are effectively aware that our business activities pose potential risks to the environment and that we rely on resources such as energy, water and building materials. As a result, we must make every effort now and in the future to minimize any detrimental influence on the environment. To do this, we have established rigorous environmental standards for ourselves.</p>
                            <p class="disc"> Environmental concerns are an essential component of our HSSE management system. To reduce detrimental consequences, our HSSE policy requires that we use energy and raw materials effectively, avoid pollution, and develop environmental consciousness among our staff. We have been documenting the frequency and volume of product releases, the amount of energy and water consumed, and the trash created at our facilities for many years, and have established related KPIs that allow us to better identify and analyze our progress. Furthermore, in order to assess our influence on climate change, our holding firm Marquard & Bahls assesses the group's carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint.</p>
                            <p class="disc">  In accordance with our HSSE management, we also check the groundwater quality on our tank terminals on a regular basis as a preventive precaution. Our environmental professionals centrally examine the collected data.  </p>

                                    <h4>Savings & Energy Consumption</h4>
                                    <p class="disc">In its offices, as well as to run buildings, sites, and vehicles, our firm employs both direct and indirect energy sources. Natural gas, heating oil, and fuel for the functioning of our pumps, boilers, and operating vehicles are examples of direct energy use. Indirect energy, mostly electricity, is utilized for a variety of purposes, including product pumps, illumination at our tank terminals, and, last but not least, computers in our offices across the world. We also employ district heating and, to a lesser extent, imported steam as indirect sources of energy. </p>
                                    <p class="disc">The pumping at the tank terminals is the most energy-intensive activity. Local activities are coordinated with our thorough Energy Saving Guideline to recognize possible savings and take actions to increase energy efficiency. Further potential for savings for the individual work environment can be recognized at other sites, and general suggestions can be developed.</p>

                            <p class="disc">The rapid technological advancements of our era have led to a significant increase in data files and their interconnectedness. While this offers undeniable benefits, it also introduces new risks. Aligned with our values of integrity and social responsibility, as outlined in the Marquard & Bahls Code of Conduct, we prioritize the protection of personal data, be it customer, supplier, or employee information, regardless of its location.</p>
                            <p class="disc">Recognizing that technological and regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving, we consider it our responsibility to continuously enhance our risk management and security measures in response to these changes.</p>
                            <p class="disc">In light of the growing impact of social media on businesses and the potential risks it poses to privacy and other rights, we have taken proactive steps, such as the development of the Marquard & Bahls Social Media Guideline, to address these concerns and ensure the protection of sensitive information.</p>
