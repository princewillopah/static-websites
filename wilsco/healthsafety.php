                        environment and minimises the impact on it. To achieve this, Wilsco constantly

                        Wilsco also places a great deal of importance on the responsible use of energy
                        and environmental awareness. Energy consumption is limited wherever possible by
                         implementing effective measures and using smart systems. Every effort is made to
                          reduce waste output. Workers are trained to reduce wastewater, energy consumption
                           and the use of chemicals. Wilsco conducts its environmental policy
                        through proper governance and fully complies with the environmental legislation.
