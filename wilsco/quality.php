                    Extensive quality management over the last 15 years has resulted in a 
                    far-reaching renewal initiative for the terminals, 
                    barges and equipment. As well as improving general operational safety, 
                    this has brought the quality of the terminals and ships up to the highest level.
                    </p> 
                    <p style="color:black; font-weight:bold;">A TOTALLY RENOVATED INFRASTRUCTURE</p>   
                    <p class="paragraph"> 
                        New pipes have been installed, electricity cables replaced, 
                        a new steam boiler put into operation and more than 50 
                        per cent of the tanks have been renewed, a substantial proportion
                        of which are stainless steel.
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The risk of breakdown or contamination of products
                        has been minimised with the newly developed automation
                        system. This controls pipes, connections, valves and 
                        tanks in such a way that human error is virtually eliminated.
