						 <p>              
							With access to a network of fleet partners, we’re positioned to deliver refined products and fuels anywhere in the nation. All petroleum distribution companies deliver their gasoline and diesel fuel products via truck transportation. Petroleum trucks are categorized by two basic sizes: transport and tank wagon. The word transport and tank wagon describe the general capacity of the size of the “tanker” that the truck is hauling. Some petroleum distribution truck fleets rely heavily on transport tankers, while other petroleum companies mostly maintain tank wagon-sized tankers. Our fleet partners own and operate a delivery fleet that maintains both transport and tank wagon trucks. The versatility of delivery is a key component to successfully serving our customers’ wide variety of needs.
