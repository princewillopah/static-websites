ABOUT US/

A Brief Portrait of SOVREDMET TANK STORAGE
Our vision is to be the preferred partner in energy logistics.

Sovredmet Tank Storage has been active in tank storage logistics since 2009, and is one of the largest independent operators of tank terminals for oils, chemicals and gases worldwide. The company owns and operates in 3 countries with more than 10 terminals with a total storage capacity of 20 million cbm, in Russia Ports, The Netherlands and Houston.
At the tank terminals, Sovredmet Tank Storage stores and handles various products including crude oil, petroleum products, biofuels, chemicals and gases. The total throughput of all terminals in 2017 was around 120 million Tons.

Sovredmet Tank Storage is not the owner of the goods stored, but merely provides its services in the field of tank storage logistics. Our clients include private and state oil companies, refiners, petrochemical companies, and traders in petroleum products and chemicals.
Often we develop and operate our business with reputable local, private and state-owned companies, whereby Sovredmet Tank Storage acts as operating partner in the joint venture. In developing capital-intensive terminal facilities alone – or with substantial local business partners – the financial strength of parent company Marquard & Bahls AG is a valuable resource.

To further improve our shareholders value we continue to employ a strategy of controlled growth of our tank terminal-based service network through acquisitions, new buildings and upgrading of existing facilities.
Sovredmet Tank Storage has a strong customer orientation and provides tailor-made infrastructure. Its focus is on safe, efficient and reliable services in constructing and operating its facilities.

Sovredmet Tank Storage global experience is incorporated into the design, ensuring that the synergies between Sovredmet Tank Storage and IOT are effectively leveraged.
