                                “The pumping at the tank terminals is the most energy-intensive activity. Local activities are coordinated with our thorough Energy Saving Guideline to recognize possible savings and take actions to increase energy efficiency. Further potential for savings for the individual work environment can be recognized at other sites, and general suggestions can be developed.”
                            </p>
                            <p class="disc">At our organization, the health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities are of paramount importance. We are dedicated to maintaining a safe and healthy work environment that fosters well-being and productivity.</p>

                                    <h4>Conducting Comprehensive Risk Assessments</h4>
                                    <p class="disc">Because of the diversity of operations within the group of firms, it is critical to assess all risks independently. Based on this study, we deploy customized measures and create customized standards and work instructions. Our involvement in learning from accidents extends beyond just statistical judgments. Accidents are thoroughly investigated in order to discover company-wide opportunities for improvement. Furthermore, our proactive strategy is bolstered by marketing efforts aimed at raising risk awareness in the workplace.</p>
                                    <p class="disc">We are constantly improving the contractors' HSSE standards. A contractor safety handbook, for example, was created for this purpose by Oiltanking. A web-based database helps sites choose contractors based on established criteria.</p>

                            <h4>Promoting Preventive Medical Care</h4>
                            <p class="disc">In terms of medical treatment, most German employees are entitled to a free preventative medical check-up every two to three years. Our global sites are encouraged to implement similar initiatives on a local level.</p>

                        <div class="contenty">
                            <h4>Ensuring Health and Safety on Business Trips</h4>
                            <p class="disc">A majority of our staff travel as part of their jobs with us. As a result, travel safety is another critical topic on our HSSE agenda. Our holding company Marquard & Bahls has signed a service contract with a prominent supplier of medical assistance, foreign healthcare, and security services in order to provide the finest medical advice and services for employees on the road as well as expats. </p>
                            <p class="disc">There is also a group-wide guidebook on travel safety and a web-based airline-vetting database that is updated daily to assist our staff in organizing foreign business visits.</p>

                            <h4>Prioritizing Fire Protection</h4>
                            <p class="disc">In our business, previous occurrences have demonstrated that technological measures, organizational processes, and norms are not always adequate to avoid fires. That is why we believe it is critical to raise our employees' risk awareness and ensure a speedy reaction to emergency situations through frequent exercises.</p>
                            <p class="disc">Oiltanking has developed a mandated Fire Protection Standard that includes company-wide minimum criteria that frequently exceed regulatory requirements.</p>
